# Phase 01 — AI/ML Internship Tasks (DevelopersHub Corporation)

This folder contains my Phase 01 work for the **AI/ML Engineering Internship** at **DevelopersHub Corporation**.  
Phase 01 consists of evaluation tasks. In this phase, I have completed **Task 1 (Iris Dataset EDA)** and will be completing the following next:
- **General Health Query Chatbot**
- **Mental Health Support Chatbot**

## Folder Structure (Phase 01)

Recommended structure:

- `Task-01_Iris-EDA/` ✅ Completed
- `Task-04_General-Health-Chatbot/` ⏳ Planned
- `Task-05_Mental-Health-Chatbot/` ⏳ Planned

Each task folder contains:
- A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) and/or Python scripts
- Task-specific notes (README inside the folder, if needed)
- Any assets (screenshots, outputs)

---

## Progress

- [x] **Task 01: Iris Dataset Exploration & Visualization**
- [ ] **Task 04: General Health Query Chatbot (Prompt Engineering)**
- [ ] **Task 05: Mental Health Support Chatbot (Chatbot / Fine-tuning or LLM-based)**

## ✅ Task 01 — Iris Dataset (EDA + Visualization)

**Objective:**  
Explore and visualize the Iris dataset using basic EDA and plots.

**What I did:**
- Loaded and inspected the dataset
- Cleaned/checked missing values (if any)
- Performed exploratory analysis
- Created visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, histograms, box plots)

**Files:**
- Notebook: `Task-01_Iris-EDA/<your_notebook_name>.ipynb`

**Key Results / Insights (add yours):**
- (e.g., which features separate species well)
- (e.g., any interesting distributions/outliers)

## ⏳ Task 04 — General Health Query Chatbot (Planned)

**Objective:**  
Build a general health Q/A chatbot using prompt engineering and safety-aware responses.

**Planned Features:**
- Friendly health-related Q/A (general guidance, not diagnosis)
- Safety instructions (encourage consulting a doctor for serious symptoms)
- Clear refusal for unsafe/medical diagnosis requests
- Example conversations

**Folder:** `Task-04_General-Health-Chatbot/`

---

## ⏳ Task 05 — Mental Health Support Chatbot (Planned)

**Objective:**  
Build a supportive mental health chatbot that responds empathetically and responsibly.

**Planned Features:**
- Supportive and empathetic responses
- Safety behavior for self-harm crisis situations (encourage professional help)
- Clear boundaries: not replacing a therapist/doctor
- Testing through CLI or a simple UI (optional)

**Folder:** `Task-05_Mental-Health-Chatbot/`

## How to Run (Optional)

If a task requires dependencies, I will include a `requirements.txt` inside that task folder.

Typical setup:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
